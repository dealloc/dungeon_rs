# `DungeonRS assets`

This crate handles the management of asset libraries.
Asset libraries are collections of image files that have been categorised and
grouped in a way that can be searched.

The idea is that you can point DungeonRS at a directory containing image folders,
and this crate handles making those available as well providing features like search,
thumbnailing and configuring (sizing, tiling, ...).
